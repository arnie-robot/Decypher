You are called the arm.
Targets are called objects.
The coordinate space is x, y, z.
The initial action is start.

Create an action called start.

The start trajectory has one step.
The first step is move to 0, 0, 0.
Enable trajectory verification.

Start has one decision.
The first decision is called testLit.

Execute testLit after the first trajectory step.
The arm can be in any position for testLit.
There must be one object, at any position, with a certainty of 75 (threshold 25) for testLit.
The success action for testLit is lightSelf with no delay.
The failure action for testLit is start with no delay.

Start's reset condition is action start, timeout -1, no delay.

Create an action called lightSelf.

The lightSelf trajectory has four steps.
The first step is to move to the y position of the object found in start action testLit decision.
The second step is to move to the x position of the object found in start action testLit decision.
The third step is to move to the z position of the object found in the start action testLit decision.
The final step is to move x and z positions to zero.
Trajectory verification is enabled.

lightSelf has one decision.
This is called testLit.
The arm's x position must be 0 (threshold 10) for testLit.
The arm's y position must be the position of the object found in start action testLit decision y posision (threshold 10) for testLit.
The arm's z position must be 0 (threshold 10) for testLit.
There must be one object, at x position 0 (threshold 10), y position equal to the object found in start action testLit decision y position (threshold 10, z position 0 (threshold 10), with a certainty of 75 (threshold 25) for testLit.
The success action for testLit is lightOther with no delay.
The failure action for testLit is lightSelf with no delay.

lightSelf's reset condition is action start, timeout 3, no delay.

Create an action called lightOther.

The lightOther trajectory has four steps.
The first step is to move to 0, 50, 0.
The second step is to move to -50, 50, 0.
The penultimate step is to move to -50, 50, 50.
The final step is to move to 0, 50, 0.
Enable trajectory verification.

lightOther has one decision.
The first decision is called testLit.
The arm's x position must be 0 (threshold 10) for testLit.
The arm's y position must be 50 (threshold 10) for testLit.
The arm's z position must be 0 (threshold 10) for testLit.
There must be one object, at position -50, 50, 50 (threshold 10), with certainty 75 (threshold 25) for testLit.
The success action for testLit is start, no delay.
The failure action for testLit is lightOther, no delay.

lightOther's reset condition is action start, timeout 3, with no delay.
